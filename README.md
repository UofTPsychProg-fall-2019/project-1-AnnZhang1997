# Experiment Description
My experiment seeks to demonstrate multiple time of day memory in mice through behaviour testing.

48 mice will be randomly divided into 4 experiment groups, differing in the stimulus and the time of day that they are tested for.
The influence of time and place will be counterbalanced.

The experiment itself contains three sessions: 
    
    The habituation session, during which the mouse will be put into the alley connecting the two chambers and allowed to explore freely for 10 minutes. The time that the mouse spent in each place will be recorded.
    The training session, which contains 8 trials. In the odd trials, each mouse will receive the assigned stimulus in their paired chamber at their assigned timepoint for 10 minutes. In the even trials, the mouse will be put into the unpaired chamber for 10 minutes without any stimulus. 
    The testing session, during which the mouse will be put into the alley connecting the two chambers at its assigned testing time and allowed to explore freely for 10 minutes. The time that the mouse spent in each place will be recorded.

The module "main.py" should be run with Psychopy, the text instructions will tell you whether other modules should be run:\
    
    Module "Class.py" is a supplementary module for "AssignSubject.py" and should not be run independently.\
    Module "AssignSubject.py" should be run with spyder or other Python environments when an original csv file containing mice information does not exist.
